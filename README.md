OpenLibrary Database - Book Explorer is an interactive web application that allows you to dive into the world of literature using data from the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api). This project dynamically fetches book data and presents it in a modern, responsive design developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience on any device, whether on desktop, tablet, or mobile.
- **Open Library Integration:** Explore a vast collection of books using the free and open Open Library API.
- **Book Filtering & Search:** Easily filter and search for books by title, author, or subject.
- **Pagination:** Navigate efficiently through numerous results with an intuitive pagination system.
- **Dynamic Modal:** Click on any book card to open a modal that displays detailed information such as:
  - Title
  - Author(s)
  - Publication Year
  - Subjects
  - Cover Image (when available)
  - Additional relevant details

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**
- **Bootstrap 5**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This web application runs in any modern website browser without requiring additional dependencies. For development purposes, a code editor with live preview functionality (e.g., Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension) is highly recommended.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
git clone https://github.com/bocaletto-luca/OpenLibrary-Database.git cd book-explorer

2. **Launch the Application**

- Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
- Alternatively, run a live-reload server via your code editor to preview changes in real time.

## How It Works

- **Data Fetching:** The application uses JavaScript's Fetch API to retrieve book data from the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api). It processes the JSON data to dynamically generate book cards.
- **Filtering & Search:** Users can input keywords or filter by specific criteria to quickly find books of interest. The results update dynamically based on the filter applied.
- **Pagination:** To handle large datasets, the app implements a pagination system that divides the results into manageable pages.
- **Dynamic Modal Display:** Clicking on a book card opens a modal window that presents further details about the selected book, including its cover, author(s), publication date, and more.
